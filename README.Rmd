# RWmisc

This package contains convenience functions I have written to help deal with
spatial data spread across multiple UTM zones and aggregating raster data to
overlapping polygons.

# Installation

To install the latest release on CRAN:

```{r cran-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("RWmisc")
```

You can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-install, eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

# Examples

The functions contained in this package serve to make working with spatial data
on large scale easy, as when carrying out cross-national analyses with spatial
data. The function `projectUTM` can project `sf` and `sp` objects in latitude,
longitude coordinate reference systems, and can even re-project
already-projected objects in other projected coordinate reference systems.

```{r projectUTM}
library(sf)
library(RWmisc)

nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))

projectUTM(nc)
```

The `theme_rw` function is the minimalist theme I often use for figure in my
work. While it is useful for standard plots, it is an especially large
improvement over the `ggplot2` defaults for maps.

```{r theme_rw, fig.show = 'hold'}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(aes(fill = BIR74), data = nc) +
  geom_sf()

ggplot(aes(fill = BIR74), data = nc) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_rw()
```
